# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Introduction
This is a capstone project which concludes the Google Data Analytic professional course.

Cyclistic Bike-Share is a ficticious company that provides bike services in the state of Chicago, USA. 

They have two kinds of customers:
the casual customers and the annual members.

The casual customers are customers who purchase ride time or daily service while the annual members have annual membership with the company.

In this project, I use python to analyze the ficticious companies 
dataset to find out how casual customers use 
Cyclistic bike services differently from members, 
as herein lies the key of converting casual customers 
to memebers which will be more profitable to 
Cyclistic Bike-Share.

This repository consist of the python notebook for the analysis,
and the slide presentation of the analysis in pptx format. But you can also view the skides via <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rjwikUeFNoe0W4ln94iskeX9n3HqEItH_sb8kp1UoAM/edit?usp=sharing">this link</a> as well.

## Methodology
+ The series of tables were extracted and converted to csv files using python.
+ The csv's were exported to tableau to create the visializations.
+ Screenshots of the visualizations were used to create the slide presentation which renders and explains the insights gotten from the proir analysis.
