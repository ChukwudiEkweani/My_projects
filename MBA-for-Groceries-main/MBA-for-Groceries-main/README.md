# MBA-for-Groceries

## Purpose
In this project, a process called the Market Basket Analysis is demonstrated on a groceries dataset using the Apriori algorithm.
In this project, we are going to find the most purchased product and what products we can use for promoting another.

## Description
Market Basket Analysis is a powerful tool for translating vast amounts of customer transactions and viewing data into simple rules for product promotion and recommendation. It allows us, for instances, identifying products that are frequently bought together and from there building recommendations based on this information (e.g., bundles to offer, which items to present close to each other, how to improve inventory management, which items to upsell).

Apriori algorithm refers to the algorithm which is used to calculate the association rules between objects. It means how two or more objects are related to one another. In other words, we can say that the apriori algorithm is an association rule leaning that analyzes that people who bought product A also bought product B.

The primary objective of the apriori algorithm is to create the association rule between different objects. The association rule describes how two or more objects are related to one another. Apriori algorithm is also called frequent pattern mining. Generally, you operate the Apriori algorithm on a database that consists of a huge number of transactions.

Market Basket Analysis is also a tool that helps people save time and have fun.This tool can also be used to build recommendation engines such as the ones used by Netflix and Spotify.

### Dependencies
The libraries used for this analysis include the following:
+ pandas for manipulation and data wrangling.
+ matplotlib and seaborn for plotting graphs and chats
+ numpy for numerical calculations
+ mlxtend for the apriori algorithm
